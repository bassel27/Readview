There are many animals which have what are called dominance contests. They rush at each other with horns—trying to knock each other down, not gore each other. They fight with their paws—with claws\nsheathed. But why with their claws sheathed? Surely, if they used their claws, they would stand a better chance of winning? But then their enemy might unsheathe their claws as well, and instead of resolving the dominance contest with a winner and a loser, both of them might be\nseverely hurt.”\nProfessor Quirrell gaze seemed to come straight out at Harry from the repeater screen. “What you demonstrated today, Mr. Potter, is that— unlike those animals who keep their claws sheathed and accept the results—you do not know how to lose a dominance contest. When a Hogwarts professor challenged you, you did not back down. When it looked like you might lose, you unsheathed your claws, heedless of the danger. You escalated, and then you escalated again. It started with a slap at you from Professor Snape, who was obviously dominant over you. Instead of losing, you slapped back and lost ten points from Ravenclaw. Soon you were talking about leaving Hogwarts. The fact that you escalated even further in some unknown direction, and somehow won at the end, does not change the fact that you are an idiot.”                                                                                                                                     “The next time, Mr. Potter, that you choose to escalate a contest rather than lose, you may lose all the stakes you place on the table. I cannot guess what they were today. I can guess that they were far, far too high for the loss of ten House points.”                                                       “I would have taken the slap, waited, and picked the best possible time to make my move,” Harry said, his voice hoarse. “But that would have meant losing. Letting him be dominant over me. It was what the Dark Lord couldn’t do with the Master he wanted to learn from.” Professor Quirrell nodded. “I see that you have understood perfectly."}, {"quote": "There was a legendary episode in social psychology called the Robbers Cave experiment. It had been set up in the bewildered aftermath of World War II, with the intent of investigating the causes and remedies of conflicts between groups. The scientists had set up a summer camp for 22 boys from 22 different schools, selecting them to all be from stable middle-class families. The first phase of the experiment had been intended to investigate what it took to start a conflict between groups. The 22 boys had been divided into two groups of 11——and this had been quite sufficient. The hostility had started from the moment the two groups had become aware of each others’ existences in the state park, insults being hurled on the first meeting. They’d named themselves the Eagles and the Rattlers (they hadn’t needed names for themselves when they thought they were the only ones in the park) and had proceeded to develop contrasting group stereotypes, the Rattlers thinking of themselves as roughand-tough and swearing heavily, the Eagles correspondingly deciding to think of themselves as upright-and-proper. The other part of the experiment had been testing how to resolve group conflicts. Bringing the boys together to watch fireworks hadn’t worked at all. They’d just shouted at each other and stayed apart. What had worked was warning them that there might be vandals in the park, and the two groups needing to work together to solve a failure of the park’s water system. A common task, a common enemy.\nHarry had a strong suspicion Professor Quirrell had understood this principle very well indeed when he had chosen to create three armies per year.\nThree armies.\nNot four.\nAnd definitely not segregated by House… except that no Slytherins had been assigned to Draco besides Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle."}, {"quote": "The Prisoner’s Dilemma, according to Harry’s teachings, ran thus: Two prisoners had been locked in separate cells. There was evidence against each prisoner, but only minor evidence, enough for a prison sentence of two years apiece. Each prisoner could opt to defect and betray the other; and this would take one year off their own prison sentence but add two years to the other’s. Or a prisoner could cooperate, staying silent. So if both prisoners defected, each testifying against the other, they would serve three years apiece; if both cooperated, or stayed silent, they would serve two years each; but if one defected and the other cooperated, the defector would serve a single year, and the cooperator would serve four. And both prisoners had to make their decision without knowing the other one’s choice, and neither would be given a chance to change their decision afterward.\nDraco had observed that if the two prisoners had been Death Eaters during the Wizarding War, the Dark Lord would have killed any traitors. Harry had nodded and said that was one way to resolve the Prisoner’s Dilemma—and in fact both Death Eaters would want there to be a Dark\nLord for exactly that reason.\n(Draco had asked Harry to stop and let him to think about this for a while before they continued. It had explained a lot about why Father and his friends had agreed to serve under a Dark Lord who often wasn’t nice to them…)\nIn fact, Harry had said, this was pretty much the reason why people had governments—you might be better off if you stole from someone else, just like each prisoner would be individually better off if they defected in the Prisoner’s Dilemma. But if everyone thought like that, the country would fall into chaos and everyone would be worse off, like what would happen if both prisoners defected. So people let themselves be ruled by governments, just like the Death Eaters had let themselves be ruled by the Dark Lord.\nHarry had continued afterward, the fear of a third party punishing you was not the only possible reason to cooperate in the Prisoner’s Dilemma.\nSuppose, Harry had said, you were playing the game against a magically produced identical copy of yourself.\nHarry had nodded again, and said that this was yet another solution to the Prisoner’s Dilemma—people might cooperate because they cared about each other, or because they had senses of honor, or because they wanted to preserve their reputation. Indeed, Harry had said, it was rather difficult to construct a true Prisoner’s Dilemma—in real life, people usually cared about the other person, or their honor or their reputation or a Dark Lord’s punishment or something besides the prison sentences. But suppose the copy had been of someone completely selfish—\n(Pansy Parkinson had been the example they’d used) —so each Pansy only cared what happened to her and not to the other Pansy.\nGiven that this was all Pansy cared about… and that there was no Dark Lord… and Pansy wasn’t worried about her reputation… and Pansy either had no sense of honor or didn’t consider herself obligated to the other prisoner… then would the rational thing be for Pansy to cooperate, or defect?\nSome people, Harry said, claimed that the rational thing to do was for Pansy to defect against her copy, but Harry, plus someone named Douglas Hofstadter, thought these people were wrong. Because, Harry had said, if Pansy defected—not at random, but for what seemed to her like rational reasons—then the other Pansy would think exactly the same way. Two identical copies wouldn’t decide different things. So Pansy had to choose between a world in which both Pansies cooperated, or a world in which both Pansies defected, and she was better off if both copies cooperated. And if Harry had thought ‘rational’ people did defect in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, then he wouldn’t have done anything to spread that kind of ‘rationality’, because a country or a conspiracy full of ‘rational’ people would dissolve into chaos. You would tell your enemies about ‘rationality’."}, {"quote": "You know, Draco, just as the fundamental question of rationality is ‘What do I think I know and how do I think I know it?’, there’s also a cardinal sin, a way of thinking that’s the opposite\nof that.

Like if you ask three separate groups of Canadian households how much they’ll pay to save two thousand, twenty thousand, or two hundred thousand birds from dying in oil ponds, the three groups will respectively state that they’re willing to pay seventy-eight, eighty-eight, and eighty dollars. No difference, in other words. It’s called scope insensitivity. Your brain imagines a single bird struggling in an oil pond, and that image creates some amount of emotion that determines your willingness to pay. But no one can visualize even two thousand of anything, so the quantity just gets thrown straight out the window.

Hogwarts was literally optimal, not in all the realms of possibility maybe, but certainly on the real planet Earth, it was the Maximum Fun Location.\nHow could the castle and its grounds seem so much smaller, so much more confining, how could the rest of the world become so much more interesting and important, the instant Harry had been told that he wasn’t allowed to leave? He’d spent months here and hadn’t felt claustrophobic then.\nYou know the research on this, observed some part of himself, it’s just standard scarcity effects, like that time where as soon as a county outlawed phosphate detergents, people who’d never cared before drove to the next county in order to buy huge loads of phosphate detergent, and surveys showed that they rated phosphate detergents as gentler and more effective and even easier-pouring… and if you give two-year-olds a choice between a toy in the open and one protected by a barrier they can go around, they’ll ignore the toy in the open and go for the one behind the barrier… salespeople know that they can sell things just by telling the customer it might not be available… it was all in Cialdini’s book Influence, everything you’re feeling right now, the grass is always greener on the side that’s not allowed.\nIf Harry hadn’t been told that he couldn’t leave, he probably would’ve jumped at the chance to stay at Hogwarts over the summer……but not the rest of his life."}, {"quote": "You know, said the part of him that refined his skills, didn’t you sort of ponder, once, how every different profession has a different way to be excellent, how an excellent teacher isn’t like an excellent plumber; but they all have in common certain methods of not being stupid; and that one of the most important such techniques is to face up to your little mistakes before they turn into BIG mistakes? …although this already seemed to qualify as a BIG mistake, actually…\nThe point being, said his inner monitor, it’s getting worse literally by the minute. The way spies turn people is, they get them to commit a little sin, and then they use the little sin to blackmail them into a bigger sin, and then they use THAT sin to make them do even bigger things and then the blackmailer owns their soul.\nDidn’t you once think about how the person being blackmailed, if they could foresee the whole path, would just decide to take the punch on the first step, take the hit of exposing that first sin?

Do you see the similarity here, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres?"}, {"quote": "Stanley Milgram had done the Milligram experiment to investigate the causes of World War\nII, to try to understand why the citizens of Germany had obeyed Hitler. So he had designed an experiment to investigate obedience, to see if Germans were, for some reason, more liable to obey harmful orders from authority figures.\nFirst he’d run a pilot version of his experiment on American subjects, as a control. And afterward he hadn’t bothered trying it in Germany. Experimental apparatus: A series of 30 switches set in a horizontal line, with labels starting at ‘15 volts’ and going up to ‘450 volts’, with labels for each group of four switches. The first group of four labeled ‘Slight Shock’, the sixth group labeled ‘Extreme Intensity Shock’, the seventh group labeled ‘Danger: Severe Shock’, and the two last switches left over labeled just ‘XXX’.\nAnd an actor, a confederate of the experimenter, who had appeared to the true subjects to be someone just like them: someone who had answered the same ad for participants in an experiment on learning, and who had lost a (rigged) lottery and been strapped into a chair, along with the electrodes. The true experimental subjects had been given a slight shock from the electrodes, just so that they could see that it worked. The true subject had been told that the experiment was on the effects of punishment on learning and memory, and that part of the test was to see if it made a difference what sort of person administered the punishment; and that the person strapped to the chair would try to memorize sets of word pairs, and that each time the ‘learner’ got one wrong, the ‘teacher’ was to administer a successively stronger shock.\nAt the 300-volt level, the actor would stop trying to call out answers and begin kicking at the wall, after which the experimenter would instruct the subjects to treat non-answers as wrong answers and continue.\nAt the 315-volt level the pounding on the wall would be repeated. After that nothing would be heard. If the subject objected or refused to press a switch, the experimenter, maintaining an impassive demeanor and dressed in a gray lab coat, would say ‘Please continue’, then ‘The experiment requires that you continue’, then ‘It is absolutely essential that you continue’, then ‘You have no other choice, you must go on’. If the fourth prod still didn’t work, the experiment halted there.\nBefore running the experiment, Milgram had described the experimental setup, and then asked fourteen psychology seniors what percentage of subjects they thought would go all the way up to the 450-volt level, what percentage of subjects would press the last of the two switches marked XXX, after the victim had stopped responding.\nThe most pessimistic answer had been 3%.\nThe actual number had been 26 out of 40.\nThe subjects had sweated, groaned, stuttered, laughed nervously, bitten their lips, dug their fingernails into their flesh. But at the experimenter’s prompting, they had, most of them, gone on administering what they believed to be painful, dangerous, possibly lethal electrical shocks. All the way to the end.                                                                                                               Harry could hear Professor Quirrell laughing, in his mind; the Defense Professor’s voice saying something along the lines of: Why, Mr. Potter, even I had not been so cynical; I knew men would betray their most cherished principles for money and power, but I did not realize that a stern look also sufficed.\nIt was dangerous, to try and guess at evolutionary psychology if you weren’t a professional evolutionary psychologist; but when Harry had read about the Milgram experiment, the thought had occurred to him that situations like this had probably arisen many times in the ancestral environment, and that most potential ancestors who’d tried to disobey Authority were dead. Or that they had, at least, done less well for themselves than the obedient. People thought themselves good and moral, but when push came to shove, some switch flipped in their brain, and it was suddenly a lot harder to heroically defy Authority than they thought.\nEven if you could do it, it wouldn’t be easy, it wouldn’t be some effortless display of heroism. You would tremble, your voice would break, you would be afraid; would you be able to defy Authority even then?\nHarry blinked, then; because his brain had just made the connection between Milgram’s experiment and what Hermione had done on her firs day of Defense class, she’d refused to shoot a fellow student, even when Authority had told her that she must, she had trembled and been afraid but she had still refused. Harry had seen that happen right in front of his own eyes and he still hadn’t made the connection until now…                                                                                   Milgram had tried certain other variations on his test. In the eighteenth experiment, the experimental subject had only needed to call out the test words to the victim strapped into the chair, and record the answers, while someone else pressed the switches. It was the same apparent suffering, the same frantic pounding followed by silence; but it wasn’t you pressing the switch. You just watched it happen and read the questions to the person being tortured.\n37 of 40 subjects had continued their participation in that experiment to the end, the 450-volt end marked ‘XXX’. And if you were Professor Quirrell, you might have decided to feel cynical\nabout that.\nBut 3 out of 40 subjects had refused to participate all the way to the end.\nThe Hermiones.\nThey did exist, in the world, the people who wouldn’t fire a Simple Strike Hex at a fellow student even if the Defense Professor ordered them to do it. The ones who had sheltered Gypsies and Jews and homosexuals in their attics during the Holocaust, and sometimes lost their lives for it.\nAnd were those people from some other species than humanity? Did they have some extra gear in their heads, some additional chunk of neural circuitry, which lesser mortals did not possess? But that was not likely, given the logic of sexual reproduction which said that the genes for complex machinery would be scrambled beyond repair, if they were not universal.\nWhatever parts Hermione was made from, everyone had those same parts inside them somewhere……well, that was a nice thought but it wasn’t strictly true, there was such a thing as literal brain damage, people could lose genes and the complex machine could stop working, there were sociopaths and psychopaths, people who lacked the gear to care. Maybe Lord Voldemort had been born like that, or maybe he had known good and yet still chosen evil; at this point it didn’t matter in the slightest. But a supermajority of the population ought to be capable of learning to do what Hermione and Holocaust resisters did.\nThe people who had been run through the Milgram experiment, who had trembled and sweated and nervously laughed as they went all the way to pressing the switches marked ‘XXX’, many of them had written to thank Milgram, afterward, for what they had learned about themselves."}, {"quote": "Harry ate another bite of his cereal, his eyes going distant now, no longer meeting her own. “Think of it this way: You skip school one day, and you lie and tell your teacher you were sick. The teacher tells you to bring a doctor’s note, so you forge one. The teacher says she’s going to\ncall the doctor to check, so you have to give her a fake number for the doctor, and get a friend to pretend to be the doctor when she calls—”\n“You did what?”\nHarry looked up from his cereal then, and now he was smiling. “I’m not saying I really did that, Hermione…” Then his eyes abruptly dropped back down to his cereal. “No. Just an example. Lies propagate, that’s what I’m saying. You’ve got to tell more lies to cover them up, lie about every fact that’s connected to the first lie. And if you kept on lying, and you kept on trying to cover it up, sooner or later you’d even have to start lying about the general laws of thought. Like, someone is selling you some kind of alternative medicine that doesn’t work, and any double-blind experimental study will confirm that it doesn’t work. So if someone wants to go on defending the lie, they’ve got to get you to disbelieve in the experimental method. Like, the experimental method is just for merely scientific kinds of medicine, not amazing alternative medicine like theirs. Or a good and virtuous person should believe as strongly as they can, no matter what the evidence says. Or truth doesn’t exist and there’s no such thing as objective reality. A lot of common wisdom like that isn’t just mistaken, it’s anti-epistemology, it’s systematically wrong. Every rule of rationality that tells you how to find the truth, there’s someone out there who needs you to believe the opposite.

Not delaying because you knew the right moment to do what was necessary, but delaying because you couldn’t make up your mind—there was no cunning plan which called for that.\nDid you sometimes need more information to choose? Yes, but that could also turn into an excuse for delaying; and it would be tempting to delay, when you were faced with a choice between two painful alternatives, and not choosing would avoid the mental pain for a time. So you would pick a piece of information you couldn’t easily obtain, and claim that you couldn’t possibly decide without it; that would be your excuse. Although if you knew what information you needed, knew when and how you would obtain that information, and knew what you would do depending on each possible observation, then that was less suspicious as an excuse for hesitating.\nIf you weren’t just hesitating, you ought to be able to choose in advance what you would do, once you had the extra information you claimed you needed."}, {"quote": "In a moral dilemma where you lost something either way, making the choice would feel bad either way, so you could temporarily save yourself a little mental pain by refusing to decide.

But if you’re in a flying saucer cult, since nobody can see the alien mothership anyway, you can say it’s the size of a city, or the size of the Moon. Observable things have to be constrained by evidence, but when somebody makes up a story, they can make the story as extreme as they want.

كانوا يتأكدون من إذلالهم يقدمون أعداءهموتحطيم كرامتهم ، فكانوا يعذبونهم أشد عذاب ويعزلونهم عن العالم أجمع ليحولوهم لمسوخ ذليلة فيعترفون بكل ما يوضع على ألسنتهم فيصمون أنفسهم بالخزي والعار ، ويتهمون بعضهم البعض طلبا للرحمة ، ومع ذلك لم تكن تمر سوى بضع سنوات حتى يتكرر الأمر من جديد ويتحولوا إلى شهداء وينسى الناس ما نالهم من ذل وهوان . السؤال هنا : لماذا يحدث ذلك ؟ الإجابة هي : أولا ، لأن الاعترافات التي كانوا يدلون بها كانت كاذبة ويتم انتزاعها منهم غصبا ، أما نحن فلا نرتكب مثل هذه الأخطاء ، وذلك لأن كل الاعترافات التي تحدث هنا صحيحة ، وإننا نجعلها كذلك ، بالإضافة إلى أننا لا نسمح للموتى أن يبعثوا من قبورهم ليقاومونا ، ولذلك يجب عليك التوقف عن التوهم أن الأجيال القادمة من الممكن أن تبرئ ساحتك أو تجعل منك شهيدا . إنهم لن يسمعوا عنك أبدا لأنك ستزال من سجلات التاريخ ، فسنحولك لغاز ونطلقك ي الهواء بل ستصبح منسيا فلن يتبقى منك أي شيء ، لا اسم موجود 4 سجل ولا حتى أثر في ذاكرة حية , ستمحي كل علاقة لك بالماضي وستصبح كأنك لم تكن .فكر ونستون بمرارة في نفسه : إذن لماذا كل هذا التعذيب ؟ فتوقف أوبراين عن السير في الغرفة وكأنه سمع تساؤل ونستون ، فأصبح وجهه القبيح أقرب وضاقت عيناه أكثر وقال : « ربما تتساءل لماذا نتكبد مشقة استجوابك ؟ إذا كنا سنقضي عليك قضاء نهائيا ولن يغير من ذلك اي شيء تقوله أو تفعله . هذا ما يدور به ذهنك أليس كذلك ؟ » . أجاب ونستون : « بلی » . فابتسم أوبراين ابتسامة خفيفة وقال :- لأنك العيب الذي تخلل النموذج العام ، فأنت الوصمة التي يجب محوها ، ألم أخبرك منذ لحظات قليلة أننا نختلف عن طغاة الماضي ؟ نحن لا نقبل بالطاعة السلبية أو حتى بالخضوع ، فعندما تستسلم لنا يجب أن يكون ذلك نابعا من إرادتك الحرة ، فنحن لا نقضي على الذي يضل منا ولا ندمره ، بل نسعى إلى تغيره ونقبض على عقله الباطن ونصيغه 2 قالب جديد ، فنحن نبدد كل ما يضمره من شرور وما يحمله من أوهام فنرده للحزب مجددا وليس ظاهريا فقط ولكن جوهريا أيضا . فنحن نجعله واحدا منا قبل أن نقتله ، فما لا يمكن احتماله بالنسبة لنا هو وجود فكرة خاطئة في أي مكان في العالم حتى لو كانت خفية أو عديمة القيمة ، حتى في لحظة الموت لا نسمح بأي شكل من أشكال الانحراف . ففي الماضي كان الهراطقة يسيرون نحو الخوازيق وهم يجاهرون بهرطقتهم بل ويتباهون بها ، أما ضحايا حملات التطهير الروسية فكان يحملون معتقداتهم يا رؤوسهم وهم يساقون نحو حتفهم ، ولذلك نحن نقوم بغسيل للدماغ قبل أن نقضي عليه . ألا تفعل فقد كان الطغاة يأمرون في الماضي كالتالي : يجب ' ذلك ، أما الحكام الديكتاتوريون فكانوا يقولون : يجب أن تفعل ، أما نحن فنقول : كن . ولم يسبق أن جئنا بأحد إلى هنا وخرج بعدها يعادينا أو ليقف ضدنا ، لأن الجميع يخضع لغسيل الدماغ ، حتى هؤلاء الثلاثة جونز وارنسون وراذرفورد ، الذين كنت تؤمن ا يوم ببرائتهم انفرط عقدهم وخارت قواهم ، لقد أشرفت لنفسي على إجراءات استجواباتهم ورأيتهم وهم ينهارون تدريجيا ناتليتذللوا ويبكوا ويطلبوا الرحمة ، وفي النهاية لم يكن ذلك بسبب خوفهم أو بسبب الألم الذي شعروا به ، بل لإحساسهم بالندم على ما اقترفوه . وعندما انتهينا من تطهيرهم من أوزارهم ، كانوا قد تحولوا إلى هياكل بشرية لم يتبق منها سوى الندم على ما بدر منها من جرائم تجاه الحزب والأخ الأكبر . لقد كان مؤثرا جدا رؤية كيف يشعرون نحو الأخ الأكبر من حب ، حتى أنهم توسلوا إلينا أن نطلق عليهم الرصاص حتى يتخلصوا من أوزار الماضي ."}, {"quote": ""}]}]}
